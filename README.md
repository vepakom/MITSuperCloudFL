# MITSuperCloudFL
Author: Praneeth Vepakomma

Use this to spawn a FL run across multiple clients and multiple rounds in a truly distributed setup with PyTorch using MPI (via MPI4py). This is as opposed to the simulated version of a dummy FL on a single machine. This repo was tested on MIT SuperCloud across multiple machines.
The readme will be expanded into a full-fledged tutorial in coming days.
